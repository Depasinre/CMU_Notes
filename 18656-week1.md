>  Functional programming is a programming paradigm characterized by the use of mathematical functions and the avoidance of side effect

## Mathematical function example in F#

increment a number by 1 : `Add1(x) = x + 1`

```F#
let add1 x = x + 1
```

`let` keyword defines a function

Function binding includes *function name* and *function body*

##  Syntax

- parameters are separated by space
- the output of the function is the last expression



###  F# type inference



###  Function signature

F# use type syntax for function signatures



## Function Type

All functions are values therefore have a type.

Function type is prescribed by its input and output types.

- function with generic types: 

  - if a function works with any type, the compiler automatically infers a generic type

  ```F#
  let areEqual x y = 
  	(x = y)
  ```


## Types in F#

> A **type** is a description of a set of values. A value is a member of a type. A identifier is a name supply for a type or a function in  program.

### Basic type

Data type built into F#

- byte, int, float, double
- string, char
- bool
- unit
  - indicates the absence of an actual value
  - one possible value: 0
  - strong sign of possible side effects

### Composition type

Gather types into large structures

composition with **And** or **Or** operation.

####  **Tuple**

*A grouping of unnamed but ordered values, possibly of different types.*

```F#
(1, 2)
("Haoming", "Yuan")
```

**Types**: The type of a tuple is multiplication of type of each of its components

```F#
  let personalInfo = ("Ted", "Lester", 32, 6.4, 94101)
   // type: (string * string * int * float * int)
```

- The **order** of the multiplication is important! 

Accessing tuple element via library function

- fst : return the first element of a tuple
- snd: return the second element of a tuple

**pros & cons**

- Pros:  
  - Available without definition
  - Can contain values of different types
  - lightweight structure
  
- Cons:
  - Difficult to figure out meaning of values
  
  - when dealing with multiple values, order might be confused
  
    

#### Records

*A grouping of named values* 

**Definition:** 

```F#
type Point3D = {X: float; Y:float; Z:float}
```
**Construction:**

```F#
let point3D1 = {Point3D.X = 0.1; 
				Point3D.Y= 0.2;
				Point3D.Z= 0.3}
```

 **Copy and update record expression**:

```F#
let point3D2 = {point3D1 with Y = 0.4}
```

**Pros & Cons:** 

- Pros: 

  - Allow to organize values into a type

  - Named field helps understand what a program is doing

  - Provide Class-like feature

- Cons:

  - Immutable
  
  - Has to define before using


#### Discriminated Union

/////  Blank /////

#### Option

*A Discriminated Union with two cases: value of some type and None*

```F#
type MiddleName = 
	| Name of string
	| None
```

Used when anticipated that there might or might not be a value.
