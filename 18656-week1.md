## What is functional programming?

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm characterized by the use of mathematical functions and the avoidance of side effect
>
> - fundamental approach to structuring programs
> - via application and composition of functions

### What constitutes a function? 

A function include: 

- The input
- The relationship
- The output

A function is anything which accepts exactly one input value and, when this is supplied, evaluates an expression
to generate exactly one output value.

### Properties of function

1. One input - one output

   There is always exactly one input and one output

2. Immutability

   - Value once created, can never be altered
   - The input and output values are immutable
   - Work with copies of data instead

3. Depending only on  input

   - Function output is solely determined by its input parameter
   - Can your function possibly return a different result when given the same input?
     - Mutable global variables
     - User input
     - Random numbers generator 

### Side Effect

Side effect is *an unwanted or unexpected result or condition that comes along with the desired effects of something.*

There is also **"functional" side effect**

- Observable interaction of a function with anything outside of it
- Anything more than computation of a result based on input parameters

#### Example

- Altering a variable outside of the function
- Writing data to a file
- Displaying something on the screen
- Sending data over the network

A function should have no side effect. It doesn't change the input or output.

### Pure function

Two properties make a function "pure"

1. Its output depends only on its input
2. It has no side-effects

### Referential Transparency

Calling a function with the same input results in the same output

- One can replace a function call with its result, without affecting the behavior of the program
- It makes your code easy to read and understand

## F# IDE Setup

### Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/downloadLinks to an external site.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Mathematical function example in F#

increment a number by 1 : `Add1(x) = x + 1`

```F#
let add1 x = x + 1
```

`let` keyword defines a function and binds an identifier with a function

Function binding includes *function name* and *function parameter*

Function body is an **expression** that generates a return value

##  Syntax

- Parameters are separated by space
- The output of the function is the last expression in its definition
- Use indents for multi-line functions

### Your first F# function

BMI calculator

$BMI = 703 * weight / height^{2}$

```F#
let bmi weight height = 
	703.0 * weight / (height * height) // Note: use 703.0 to make the output as float type
```

###  F# type inference

> F# infers the parameter and return types when they’re not explicitly specified

- When argument type is not specified, function body is used to infer it.
- When return type is not specified, final body expression is used to infer it

###  Function signature

F# use type syntax for function signatures.

It denotes the types used and produced by a function.

```F#
// example of function signature
int -> int -> int
```

## Function Type

All functions are values therefore have a type.

Function type is prescribed by its input and output types.

```F#
// function signature 
t_in -> t_out
```

- function with generic types: 

  - if a function works with any type, the compiler automatically infers a generic type
  - Notation: letter preceded by a tick: `a
  
  ```F#
  let areEqual x y = 
  	(x = y)
  ```

> Equality test in F# is `=` operator

## Function application

Function definition and application are separate.

Function is applied by providing its input, separated by a space

```F#
let bmi weight height = 
	703.0 * weight / (height * height) 
bmi 140.65 71.6
```

## Function interactive

To run F# code in the console: 

- Select the code you want to execute
- Click on “Option" + "Enter" in Mac OS
  - "Alt" + "Enter" in Window instead

## The power of functions

Functions can be bound to identifiers.

```F#
let plus3 x = x + 3
```

Functions can be stored in data structures.

```F#
let listofFunctions = [plus; times2]
```

Functions can be passed down as an argument to other functions.

Functions can be a return value from a function call.

## Types in F#

> A **type** is a description of a set of values and a set of allowed operations on those values
>
>  A **value** is a member of a type. 
>
> A **identifier** is a name supply for a type or a function in program.

### Basic type

Data type built into F#

- byte, int, float, double
- string, char
- bool
- unit
  - indicates the absence of an actual value
  - one possible value:  ( )
  - strong sign of possible side effects

### Composition type

Gather types into large structures

composition with **And** or **Or** operation.

####  **Tuple**

*A grouping of unnamed but ordered values, possibly of different types.*

```F#
(1, 2)
("Haoming", "Yuan")
```

Value separated by coma, encompassed by parentheses.

Tuples can contain values of multiple types.

**Types**: The type of a tuple is multiplication of type of each of its components

```F#
  let personalInfo = ("Ted", "Lester", 32, 6.4, 94101)
   // type: (string * string * int * float * int)
```

- The **order** of the multiplication is important! 

Accessing tuple element via library function

- fst : return the first element of a tuple
- snd: return the second element of a tuple

*fst and snd functions require that the tuple be a pair (2-element tuple)*

**pros & cons**

- Pros:  
  - Available without definition
  - Can contain values of different types
  - lightweight structure
  
- Cons:
  - Difficult to figure out meaning of values
  
  - when dealing with multiple values, order might be confused

**Comparison:**

If all the values in a tuple are comparable, then the tuple is comparable to another tuple of the same type. 

``` F#
let myName = ("Rafal", "Wlodarski")
let herName = ("Sarah", "Jessica", "Parker")
let cityState = ("San Francisco", "CA")
```

Tuples can be compared using equality operation.

```F#
myName = cityState // false
```

#### Records

*A grouping of named values* 

**Definition:** 

```F#
type GeoCoord = { Lat: float; Long: float }
type Point3D = {X: float; Y:float; Z:float}
```
**Construction:**

```F#
let point3D1 = {Point3D.X = 0.1; 
				Point3D.Y= 0.2;
				Point3D.Z= 0.3}
```

 **Copy and update record expression**:

```F#
let point3D2 = {point3D1 with Y = 0.4}
```

**Accessing** record elements via "dot" notation.

```F#
let geoCoord1 = { Lat = 1.1; Long = 2.2 }
let x = geoCoord1.Lat
let y = geoCoord1.Long

```

**Pros & Cons:** 

- Pros: 

  - Allow to organize values into a type

  - Named field helps understand what a program is doing

  - Provide Class-like feature

- Cons:

  - Immutable
  
  - Has to define before using

**Comparison:**

Like tuples, records have structural equality semantics

```F#
let geoCoord1 = { Lat = 1.1; Long = 2.2 }
let geoCoord2 = { geoCoord1 with Lat = 2.2 }
geoCoord1 = geoCoord2 // false
```

Two records are equal if they have the same type and the values in each slot are equal.

#### Discriminated Union

Data structure representing a set of choices.

- Supports values from a number of named cases
- Each alternative is called a case

```F#
type AppleVariety =
	| GrannySmith // a case
	| PinkLady
	| Fuji

```

- Each case must be tagged with a label, also called identifier or tag
- Each case identifier must start with am **UPPERCASE LETTER**
- Case values are optional
- Each case can have different values and types

```
type FruitSnack =
| Apple of AppleVariety // identifier of type
| Banana of BananaVariety //BananaVariety needs to be defined
```

- *"of type"* syntax allows to indicate the data type of a case

**Construction**

Use a constructor that refers to one of the possible union cases.

``` F#
type AppleVariety =
	| GrannySmith
	| PinkLady
let anApple = PinkLady // use the "PinkLady" constructor

type FruitSnack =
	| Apple of AppleVariety
	| Banana of BananaVariety
let aSnack = Apple PinkLady // use "Apple" constructor,
							// then "PinkLady" constructor
```

```F#
type Shape =
	| Rectangle of width : float * length : float
	| Circle of radius : float
```

 During initialization use the named fields or rely on ordering of fields

``` F#
let rectangle2 = Rectangle (width = 1.5, length = 2.2)
let rectanble1 = Rectangle(2.4, 3.2)
```

**Simple Type:**

A simple type discriminated union is a Discriminated Union with one case only.

```F#
type ProductCode =
| ProductCode of string
// simplified notation
type ProductCode = ProductCode of string
```

> Used as a wrapper data type for primitive values

```F#
let a = ProductCode "ABC123"
let b = "ABC223"
```

**Comparison:**

Two unions are equal if they have the same type and the same case and the values for that case is equal.

```F#
type Contact =
	| Email of string
	| Phone of int
let email1 = Email "bob@gmail.com"
let email2 = Email "bobBarley@gmail.com"
email1 = email2 // false

```

#### Option

*A Discriminated Union with two cases: value of some type and None*

```F#
type MiddleName = 
	| Name of string
	| None
type MiddleName = string option // simplified notation
```

Used when anticipated that there might or might not be a value.

### F# specific types

#### Common .NET types

- User-defined value types (enum and struct)
- Classes and interfaces
- Arrays

#### Designed for pure functional programming

- The unit type
- Tuples
- Records
- Discriminated Unions
- Option types
- Lists

### F# functional types - Advantage

1. They are immutable
2. They cannot be null
3. They have built-in structural equality  and comparison
4.  They have built-in pretty printing
