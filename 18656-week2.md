## Functions Syntax Reminder

```F#
let cylinderVolume radius length =
	length * 3.14159 * radius * radius
```

- Declared with `let` keyword and a name

- Parameters added after a space, their type automatically inferred

- Indentation mandatory to indicate a function body

- Last expression evaluates to the return value

```F#
let cylinderVolume radius length =
	length * 3.14159 * radius * radius
```

### Input / Output type

Type inference avoids the need to declare input / output types

To specify a return type, add a colon and the type after the parameters list

```
let cylinderVolume radius length : float =
	length * 3.14159 * radius * radius
```

For input parameters, encompass each om brackets and provide type after a colon.

```F#
let cylinderVolume (radius : float) (length : float) : float =
	length * 3.14159 * radius * radius

```

### Local Identifier

It can contain definitions of of local identifies and functions

- Accessible only in scope of the body of the current function

```F#
let cylinderVolume radius length =
	let pi = 3.14159
	length * pi * radius * radius
```

## Function Scope

Names can be reused at any level other than **module** scope.

- Later declaration shadow previous one

```fsharp
let list1 = [1;2;3]
let list1 = []
let function1 () = 
	let list1 = []
	list1
```

​	`Error: duplicate definition`

​	This code Error because Name reused in implicit top-level module

> This code will run if we comment line 2 out and the function will return a empty records.

## Functions as values

All function are considered values.

Function accept another function as parameter.

Function can return another function as the value of the function call.

> High order function: a function that takes another function as a parameter, or a function that returns another function as a value, or a function that does both.

### High order function example

```F#
let twice f v = // this function will call f function twice with parameter v and (f v)
	f (f v) 

let add4 x = 
	x + 4

twice add4 10

(*The output is 18*)
```

`Twice` is a higher order function because it accepts a function as parameter and returns a function



```F#
let applyToPair f (x, y) =  // parameter: f as function, (x, y) as tuple
	(f x, f y)
	
let square x = 
	x * x
	
applyToPair square (10, 100)
```

### High Order Function: Key Take ways

- A frequently used technique to construct new function from existing functions and reuse them
- Allow to express algorithms and pass functionality as parameters

## Lambda Expression

Lambda Expression is a function without a name (anonymous).

- It defined by using the `fun` keyword
- `->` separates the arguments from the function body

```F#
fun x y -> x + y
```

- Multi-line lambda are encompassed by paratheses

```F#
(fun elem a ->
	printfn $"A long line to format the value: %d{a + elem}")
```

- A lambda expression can be assigned to an identifier

```F#
let square = fun x -> x * x
let result = square 6  // function evaluation
```

### Closure

A function using identifier from the lexical scope that is defined within. 

```F#
let square = fun x -> x * x
```

- parameter of both square function and lambda expression *"close over"*

```F#
let result = square 6 // function evaluation
```

- The bidirectional interaction allow function to "remember" identifiers fron their environment when they were created.

### Usage

1. Passed as argument to other function (sort, filter, ...)

2. A function is used a limited number of times

3. Creation of small helper functions on the spot


## Currying

A functional method of handling argument

*Reminder:*

- Function can accept only 1 parameter
- Function values can be returned from a function

> Technique for simulating a multi-parameter function by sequentially returning different single parameter

### Example #1

```F#
let printTwoParameters x y = 
	printfn 'x=%i y =%i' x y
```

To , Translate the definition into one-parameterfunction. 

Inside, construct a function that takes in the nex parameter.

```F#
let printTwoParameter x = 
	let innerFun y = 
		printfn 'x=%i y =%i' x y // x in scope of innerFun
```

It return the newly created subfunction `innerFun`.

### Exercise #1

Re-write as a set of curried functions: 

```F#
let addThreeParameters x y z = 
	x + y + z
```

#### Solution

```F#
let addThreeParameters x = 
	let subMethod1 y = 
		let subMethod2 z = 
			x + y + z
		subMethod2
	subMethod1
(*
subMethod1 return subMethod2
addThreeParameter return subMethod2
subMethod2 do the job which calculate x + y + z
*)
```

For both implementation, they have the same function signature.

### Key takeaways

It ensure all F# functions accept only 1 input and evaluate to 1 output

It shows a lot of **syntactic sugar** exist in F#

### Example #2

```F#
let sum x y =
	x + y
```

- Fix the `x` parameter and vary `y` only

```F#
sum 2 3
sum 2 4
sum 2 5
```

- Write a function to make 2 a constant parameter

```
let sumBy2 y = sum 2 y
```

### Wrapper Function

Example: creation of `DateTime` Object

```F#
open system
let buildDt year month day = DateTime(year, month, day)
let buildDtThisYear month day = buildDt DateTime.UtcNow.Year month day
let buildDtThisMonth day = buildDtThisYear DateTime.YtcNow.Month day
```

- Function refactored to *bake-in* parameters

```F#
open system
let buildDt year month day = DateTime(year, month, day)
let buildDtThisYear = buildDt DateTime.UtcNow.Year
let buildDtThisMonth = buildDtThisYear DateTime.UtcNow.Month
```

> **Partial Application**: the act of calling a curried function to get back a new function

### Exercise #2

Create a wrapper function, `writeToFile`, for writing data to a text file :

- The function should take in 3 argument in this specific order: 
  - date - The current date (`DateTime` type)
  - filename - a filename
  - text - the text to write out
- The body should create a filename in the form `{date}-{filename}.txt`
- Construct date part of the filename by using `ToString("yyMMdd")`

#### Solution

```F#
open System

let writeToFile (date:DateTime) filename text = 
	let path = date.ToString("yyMMdd") + filename + ".txt"
	System.IO.File.WriteAllText(path, text)
```

#### Step 2

Create more-constrained version of `writeToFile`:

1. a version of the function to print with today's date (hint: use `DateTime.Today`)
2. a version of the function to print with a specific fixed file name and today's date
3. a version of function where only the text is fixed with "test"

#### Solution

```F#
open System

// 1
let writeToFileToday = writeToFile DateTime.today
	
// 2 
let writeToFileSpecificName = writeToFile "some specific name"
	
// 3
let writeFixedText = writeToFile date filename "test"
```

## Function Composition

Function can be composed by *"gluing them together"* to create a new function

- given functions `a -> b` and `b -> c`
- generate a new function `a -> c`

Compose `>>` operater is used for this purpose

```F#
let function1 x = x + 1
let function2 x = x * 2

let h = function1 >> function2

let result = h 100

(*
First, 100 apply to function1 which output 101
Then, 101 apply to function2, the final result is 202
*)
```

### Types

Function can be composed as long as the output type of the first one is the same as the input type of the second one

<img src='1.JPG'/>

```
let f (x:int) = float x * 3.0
let g (x:float) = x > 4.0
```

- Output of f is compatible with input of g hence functions can be composed

```
let h = f >> g

// the function signature of h is int to boolean
```

### Backwards Compose

`<<` operator composes two functions in reverse order

```
let square x = x * x
let substractTwo x = x - 2
let negate x = -x
let composedFunction = square << subtractTwo << negate
let result = composedFunction 5
// final result is 49
```

Function composition is a way to achieve **information hiding** in F#

### Exercise

Which of the following lines will compile? If there is and issue, what is it? 

```
let add n x = x + n
let times n x = x * n
let compare a b = (a = b)

let composed1 = add >> times >> compare
let composed2 = (add, times) >> compare
let composed3 = times << add 2
let composed4 = add 2 >> times
let composed5 = add 2 << times

```

#### Solution

`composed1` won't compile because `compare` is short of one parameter. `times` only output one parameter 

`composed2` won't compile because `(add, times)` is one object as a tuple but 2 value expect

`composed3` will compile which partial application makes this work

`composed4` will compile and it's equivalent of composed3

`composed5` won't compile because `times` is lack of parameter and will evaluated first

## Building an app from functions

1. Basic functions as building blocks

## Match Expression

F# Example: 

```fsharp
let x = 2
let text =
	match x with // test expression
	| 0 -> "zero”
	| 1 -> "one"
	| 2 -> "two"  // pattern -> result expression
	| _ -> "other”
// result is "two"
```

### Syntax

- The `match` keyword, preceding the expression to be evaluated
- The `with` keyword, indicating start of the values to compare against
- The vertical `pipe` character (`|`) for every pattern that will be evaluated for a match
- The arrow (`->`), preceding the expression to execute if the match is found
- Pattern matching compares a test expression with a set of patterns
- Upon a match, the corresponding result-expression is evaluated.
- Resulting value is returned from the match expression. test expression

### Expression

Expressions are constructs that evaluate to a value.
Statements are actions that a program takes.

<img src='6.JPG'/>

Functional programming paradigm firmly encourages expressions as the default way of working

- No notion of void functions
- Branching mechanisms are expressions

### Return Value

- A match expression always returns a value
- All clauses in the match expression must yield compatibly

Incomplete match expression will give a warnning

```F#
let name = "Rafal"
let result = 
	match name with 
	| "John" -> "the name is John"
	| "Bob" -> "Hi Bob"
	
// Compiler: warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression
```

### Wildcard Operator

**"_" matches any value**

Anything that doesn't match against preceding clauses will match against this one

```F#
let name = "Rafal”
let result =
	match name with
	| "John" -> "The name is John”
	| "Bob" -> "Hi Bob!”
	| _ -> "I don't know you!
```
> Pattern matching works top down. Put the most specific patterns first and the most general last.

### Nested Match Expressions

Nesting match expressions introduces code complexity and should be used only for a significant number of repeated elements.

``` F#
let customer = ("good", 0)
let limit =
	match customer with
	| "medium", 1 -> 500
	| "good", years ->
			match years with
			| 0 | 1 -> 750
			| 2 -> 1000
			| _ -> 2000
	| _ -> 250
```

### Guard

When clause (guard) allows to specify additional conditions in a match expression.

>  A guard allows to introduce any form of a check within a pattern rather than just matching against values

```F#
let customer = ("good", 0)
let limit =
	match customer with
	| "medium", 1 -> 500
	| "good", years when years <2 -> 750
	| "good", 2 -> 1000
	| "good", _ -> 2000
	| _ -> 250
```

Comparing the bound values from a test expression.
```F#
// comparing values in a when clause
let makeOrdered aTuple =
	match aTuple with
	// swap if x is bigger than y
	| (x,y) when x > y -> (y,x)
	// otherwise leave alone
	| _ -> aTuple
```

Testing properties as part of the when clause.

```F#
let isAm aDate =
	match aDate:System.DateTime with 
	| x when x.Hour <= 12 -> printfn "AM"
	| _ -> printfn "PM"
```

#### When not to use when?

The compiler won’t figure out anything that happens inside the guard.

- Exhaustive pattern matching is not performed.
- One needs to define the default (wildcard operator) case.

### Shortcut Syntax

Parameter and `match .. with` can be omitted thanks to currying

```F#
let getPrice1 food =
	match food with
	| "banana" -> 0.79
	| ”apple" -> 2.1
	| "tofu" -> 3.09
	| _ -> 0.0

let getPrice = function
	| "banana" -> 0.79
	| ”apple" -> 2.1
	| "tofu" -> 3.09
	| _ -> 0.0
```

## Pattern Matching for Structural Decomposition

Extraction and binding of specific data from within a data structure.

Pattern matching is available for all the built-in F# types.

### Tuple
"`,`" (comma) is needed to construct (and deconstruct) tuples

```F#
let z = 1, true, "hello", 3.14 // "construct" a tuple
let z1, z2, z3, z4 = z // "deconstruct" a tuple
```

- A new set of individual identifiers are bound to values from inside the tuple

"`_`" matches any input, but that the input is discarded instead of assigned to an identifier

```F#
let z = 1, true, "hello", 3.14
let _,z5,_,z6 = z // ignore 1st and 3rd elements
```

#### Exercise

For the code snippet below write down patterns to extract :
1. The value 3 from `a` and bind it to the identifier `t`
2. The value 3 from `a` and true from `b` and bind them to the identifiers `c` and `d` respectively.
*Implement it in 1 line (you can start with a 2-line notation first)*
3. The values `true` and `83` from `b` and bind them to the identifiers `e`and `f` respectively

```F#
let a = 2, 3
let b = 9.0, true, ((5, 83), a)
```

##### Solution: 

```F#
let _ , t = a // solution 1
let (_, c), (_, d, _) = a , b // solution 2
let _, e, ((_, f), _) = b // solution 3
```

### Records

"`=`" sign is used to create record values

```F#
type ComplexNumber = {Real: float; Imaginary: float}
```

Construction and deconstruction syntaxes are **Symmetric**

```F#
let myComplexNumber = { Real = 1.1; Imaginary = 2.2 }
let {Real = a; Imaginary = b} = myComplexNumber
```

"`_`" discards part of a record one doesn’t need

```F#
let {Real = a ; Imaginary = _} = myComplexNumber
```

Alternatively, one can simply ignore an unwanted label from a Record
```F#
let {Real = a} = myComplexNumber
```

### Discriminated Union

 Use a “constructor” that refers to one of the possible union cases

```F#
type CardType = Debit | Credit
type Payment =
	| CreditCard of CardType
	| Cash of float // simple type (“wrapper” DU)
	
let myPayment = CreditCard Debit // use “CreditCard” constructor
let yourPayment = Cash 120.1 // use “Cash” constructo
```

 Each case must return the same data type (Payment)

```F#
let deconstructor x =
	match x with
	| CreditCard cardType -> CreditCard cardType
	| Cash amount -> Cash amount
```

Evaluate “deconstructor” match expression to deconstruct a discriminated union

```F#
let myPayment = CreditCard Debit // use “CreditCard” constructor
let yourPayment = Cash 120.1 // use “Cash” constructor
let result1 = deconstructor myPayment
let result2 = deconstructor yourPayment
```

 A payment processing function that accepts Debit cards and cash only

```F#
let processPayment payment =
	match payment with
	| CreditCard Debit -> printfn ”Payment with Debit card"
	| CreditCard _ -> printfn "This card is not accepted" // wildcard operator
	| Cash amount -> printfn ”Cash payment of %f" amount
```

## Exercise Quiz

In programming, assignment refers to the process of storing a value in a variable. It is typically performed using the assignment operator, represented by the equals sign (=).

In functional programming, binding is the action of linking an identifier and a value. In F# it is typically performed using the let keyword.

There are four important differences between “assignment” and pattern-matching & binding.

Please fill in the text below using the following options (each is used only once):

1. assignment
2. assignment
3. binding
4. shadowing
5. pattern-matching, 
6. pattern-matching.

1. ___ cannot fail

   ___ can

2. Assignment must assign a value to at least one variable. ___ does not necessarily result in any identifiers being bound.

3. ___ always makes a copy

   ___ never causes any copies to be made

4. Re-assignment to an existing variable changes the value that is linked to that variable name. Rebinding a name does not affect any existing binding. What takes place is instead is ____.

   This means that the new binding takes precedence over the existing one.

### Answer

1. **Assignment** cannot fail. 

   **Pattern-matching** can.

2. Assignment must assign a value to at least one variable. **Pattern-matching** does not necessarily result in any identifiers being bound.

3. **Assignment** always makes a copy

   **Binding** never causes any copies to be made

4. Re-assignment to an existing variable changes the value that is linked to that variable name. Rebinding a name does not affect any existing binding. What takes place is instead is **Shadowing**.

   This means that the new binding takes precedence over the existing one.
