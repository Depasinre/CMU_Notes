## Functions Syntax Reminder

```F#
let cylinderVolume radius length =
	length * 3.14159 * radius * radius
```

- Declared with `let` keyword and a name

- 

- 

- 

### Input / Output type

Type inference avoids the need to declare input / output types

To specify a return type, add a colon and the type after the parameters list

```
let cylinderVolume radius length : float =

```

### Local Identifier

It can contain definitions of 



## Function Scope

Names can be reused at any level other than **module** scope.

- Later declaration shadow previous one

```fsharp
let list1 = [1;2;3]
let list1 = []
let function1 () = 
	let list1 = []
	list1
```

​	`Error: duplicate definition`

​	This code Error because Name reused in implicit top-level module

> This code will run if we comment line 2 out and the function will return a empty records.

## Functions as values

All function are considered values.

Function accept another function as parameter.

Function can return another function as the value of the function call.

> High order function: 

### High order function example

```F#
let twice f v = // this function will call f function twice with parameter v and (f v)
	f (f v) 

let add4 x = 
	x + 4

twice add4 10

(*The output is 18*)
```

`Twice` is a higher order function because it accepts a function as parameter and returns a function



```F#
let applyToPair f (x, y) =  // parameter: f as function, (x, y) as tuple
	(f x, f y)
	
let square x = 
	x * x
	
applyToPair square (10, 100)
```

### High Order Function: Key Take ways

- A frequently used technique to construct new function from exist ...





## Lambda Expression

Lambda Expression is a function without a name (anonymous).

- It defined by using the `fun` keyword
- `->` separates the arguments from the function body

```F#
fun x y -> x + y
```

- Multi-line lambda are encompassed by paratheses

```
```

- A lambda expression can be assigned to an identifier

```F#
let square = fun x -> x * x
let result = square 6  // function evaluation
```

*How can the function ?*

*?*

### Closure

A function using identifier from the lexical scope that is defined within. 

```F#
let square = fun x -> x * x
```

- parameter of both square function and lambda expression *"close over"*

```F#
let result = square 6 // function evaluation
```

- The bidirectional interaction allow function to "remember" identifiers fron their environment when they were created.

### Usage

1. Passed as argument to other function (sort, filter, ...)

2. A function is used a limited number of times

3. Creation of small helper functions on the spot

   

## Currying

A functional method of handling argument

*Reminder: l*

> Technique for simulating a multi-parameter function by sequentially returning ifferent single parameter

### Example #1

```F#
let printTwoParameters x y = 
	printfn 'x=%i y =%i' x y
```

To , Translate the definition into one-parameterfunction. 

Inside, construct a function that takes in the nex parameter.

```F#
let printTwoParameter x = 
	let innerFun y = 
		printfn 'x=%i y =%i' x y // x in scope of innerFun
```

It return the newly created subfunction `innerFun`.

### Exercise #1

Re-write as a set of curried functions: 

```F#
let addThreeParameters x y z = 
	x + y + z
```

#### Solution

```F#
let addThreeParameters x = 
	let subMethod1 y = 
		let subMethod2 z = 
			x + y + z
		subMethod2
	subMethod1
(*
subMethod1 return subMethod2
addThreeParameter return subMethod2
subMethod2 do the job which calculate x + y + z
*)
```

For both implementation, they have the same function signature.

### Key takeaways

It ensure all F# functions accept only 1 inut ....

...

### Example #2

```F#
let sum x y =
	x + y
```

- Fix the `x` parameter and vary `y` only

```F#
sum 2 3
sum 2 4
sum 2 5
```

- Write a function to make 2 ----

```
```

### Wrapper Function

Example: creation of `DateTime` Object

```F#
open system
let buildDt year month day = DateTime(year, month, day)
let buildDtThisYear month day = buildDt DateTime.UtcNow.Year month day
let buildDtThisMonth day = buildDtThisYear DateTime.YtcNow.Month day
```

- Function refactored to *bake-in* parameters

```F#
open system
let buildDt year month day = DateTime(year, month, day)
let buildDtThisYear = buildDt DateTime.UtcNow.Year
let buildDtThisMonth = buildDtThisYear DateTime.UtcNow.Month
```

### Exercise #2

Create a wrapper function, `writeToFile`, for writing data to a text file :

- The function should take in 3 argument in this specific order: 
  - date - The current date (`DateTime` type)
  - filename - a filename
  - text - the text to write out
- The body should create a filename in the form `{date}-{filename}.txt`
- Construct date part of the filename by using `ToString("yyMMdd")`

#### Solution

```F#
open System

let writeToFile (date:DateTime) filename text = 
	let path = date.ToString("yyMMdd") + filename + ".txt"
	System.IO.File.WriteAllText(path, text)
```

#### Step 2

Create more-constrained version of `writeToFile`:

1. a version of the function to print with today's date (hint: use `DateTime.Today`)
2. a version of the function to print with a specific fixed file name and today's date
3. a version of function where only the text is fixed with "test"

#### Solution

```F#
open System

// 1
let writeToFileToday = writeToFile DateTime.today
	
// 2 
let writeToFileSpecificName = writeToFile "some specific name"
	
// 3
let writeFixedText = writeToFile date filename "test"
```



## Function Composition

Function can be composed by *"gluing them together"* to create a new function

- given functions `a -> b` and `b -> c`
- generate a new function `a -> c`

Compopse `>>` operater is used for this purpose

```F#
let function1 x = x + 1
let function2 x = x * 2

let h = function1 >> function2

let result = h 100

(*
First, 100 apply to function1 which output 101
Then, 101 apply to function2, the final result is 202
*)
```

### Types

Function can be composed as long as the output type of the first function ....

**pic**

```
let f (x:int) = float x * 3.0
let g (x:float) = x > 4.0
```

- Output of f is compatible with input of g hence functions can be composed

```
let h = f >> g

// the function signature of h is int to boolean
```

### Backwards Compose

`<<` operator composes two functions in reverse order

```
let square x = x * x
let substractTwo x = x - 2

// final result is 49
```

### Exercise

Which of the following lines will compile? If there is and issue, what is it? 

```
let add n x = x + n
let times n x = x * n
let compare a b = (a = b)

let composed1 = add >> times >> compare
let composed2 = (add, times) >> compare
let composed3 = times << add 2
let composed4 = add 2 >> times
let composed5 = add 2 << times

```

#### Solution

`composed1` won't compile because `compare` is short of one parameter. `times` only output one parameter 

`composed2` won't compile because `(add, times)` is one object as a tuple but 2 value expect

`composed3` will compile which partial application makes this work

`composed4` will compile and it's equivalent of composed3

`composed5` won't compile because `times` is lack of parameter and will evaluated first
