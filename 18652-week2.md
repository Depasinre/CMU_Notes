## Agile Development

Agile: fast, able to quickly react to change

### Agile Methods

- **Scrum** (used the most)
- Extreme programming (XP)
- Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
- Dynamics System Development Method (DSDM)
- Adaptive Software Development
- Crystal Methods

### Agile Manifesto

In agile, We value these: 

- Individuals and interactions
- Responding to change
- Customer collaboration
- Working software

More than: 

- Processes and tools
- Comprehensive documentation
- Contract negotiation
- Following & plan

#### Compare to waterfall

The waterfall approach is inverse of the agile, which means the waterfall values Processes and tools, Comprehensive documentation, Contract negotiation and Following & plan more.

#### Compare to iterative and incremental

As the same as agile, iterative and incremental approach  also values Working software and Customer collaboration more. But for Individuals and interactions and Responding to change is not,

In interactive and incremental approach, change is expected but controlled.  A change needs to be evaluated against any risks that it might introduce to the project and the team needs to agree that the risks could be mitigated before accepting the change. 

In Agile, change is not controlled and always welcome. 

In iterative and incremental method, it tend to look at the development team as a machine following a process and overlook the human side of software engineering. 

#### Summary of comparison 

- Individuals and interactions (Agile)
- Responding to change (Agile)
- Customer collaboration (Agile, I&I)
- Working software (Agile, I&I)
- Processes and tools (Waterfall, I&I)
- Comprehensive documentation (Waterfall, I&I)
- Contract negotiation (Waterfall)
- Following & plan (Waterfall)

#### 12 Principle

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software .
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design   enhances agility.
10.   Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11.  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12.  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Scrum

#### Agile value in Scrum Practice

##### Customer Collaboration

> Principle 4: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project

This principle could be implemented differently in different methods. 

For instance, in XP, it is implemented using the practice of having a real customer available onsite. In Scrum, this is implemented using the practice of having a **Product Owner** embedded in the team.

- The Product Owner is not the real customer, but he should be working closely with the customer so he can represent the customer.

##### Responding to change

> Principle 2: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage

 This is implemented in Scrum using the practice of continuously updating and prioritizing the **Product Backlog**.

>  **Product Backlog:** It is composed of a number of features to be implemented.  These feature are prioritized by the Product Owner based on customer value.

New feature could be proposed by anyone at anytime, and also the backlog could be reprioritized. 

##### Working software

> Principle 1: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software .

This principle is implemented in Scrum using the practices of **Iterative Development** and **Sprint Review**. 

The Scrum lifecycle shows that the project is decomposed into series of iterations, called sprints. Each iteration is 2-4 weeks long, and it focuses on implementing a subset of high value features. Through out the iteration, the team meets everyday during a standup meeting. 

In addition, every sprint have a sprint review, to demo the new feature implemented. Audience is the Product Owner and other stakeholders. 

##### Individual and Interaction

> Principle 12: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

It is implemented in Scrum using the practice of **Sprint Retrospective**.

The entire team holds a retrospective after each sprint. They reflect on what went well/wrong and what to improve during the next sprint. 

 #### What is miss in Scrum as a developer? 

Scrum is a project management framework, in the sense that it provides some guidance on how to manage the project and organized the teams. 

But the scrum does not any guidance on how to perform the technical work. 

For this practice, that is where XP comes in handy. 

#### XP (Extreme Programming) technical practices example

- Test first: writing unit test before writing code.
- Pair-programming: 2 developer working on one workstation, learn from each other an improve code quality.
- incremental design: Instead of starting with a complex design that solves many problems, the idea is to start with a simplest design that solves only one problem and then continuously improve the design through refactoring. 

### Benefits of Agile

1. **Ability to manage changing priorities**
2. Increased productivity
3. Improved project visibility
4. ...

### Barrier to Agile adoption

1. **Inability to change organization culture**
2. General resistance for changing
3. Trying to fit agile elements to non-agile framework
4. ...

## Combination of Method

### Scrum vs Kanban

Scrum

- iterative (sprint = iteration)
- requirement: Flow of project-wide activities

Kanban

- Not iterative in the same way as Scrum. More like a conveyer belt or a pipeline with lots parallelism. 
- requirement: Flow describing how a piece of requirement is translate to a delivered feature. 

#### 3 Question

1. Team Composition and Roles:  How does each approach team composition? What project/team roles does each prescribe?
   1. Scrum: 
   2. Kanban: 
2. Constraints: What kind of limits does each impose on the process
   1. 
3. Practice

#### 3 Practice

**Hybrid method** with 3 practices with rationale
