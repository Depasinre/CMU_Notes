## Monolithic Development

All components are 



### Downside

Reliability

Need to redeploy the entire application on each update,

Difficulty in adopting new technology



## Microservice

The system is decomposed into modules not only at development time, but also at runtime.

Changes in one module are less likely to cause problems in other modules.

### Key characteristics

A large application built as a suite of modular services

- Each service supports a specific business goal

- Each service uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with ither service

- Loosely coupled service

  - Keep services intercommunication to minimum

> micro services is label and not the description.   --Martin Fowler

### Granularity of services

Single-purpose service that does one thing, really well. 

- Single Responsibility principle: a module should ne responsible to one, and only one, actor
