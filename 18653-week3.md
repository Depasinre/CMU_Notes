## Monolithic Development

All components are 

### Downside

Reliability

Need to redeploy the entire application on each update,

Difficulty in adopting new technology



## Microservice

The system is decomposed into modules not only at development time, but also at runtime.

Changes in one module are less likely to cause problems in other modules.

### Key characteristics

A large application built as a suite of modular services

- Each service supports a specific business goal

- Each service uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with ither service

- Loosely coupled service

  - Keep services intercommunication to minimum

> micro services is label and not the description.   --Martin Fowler

### Granularity of services

Single-purpose service that does one thing, really well. 

- Single Responsibility principle: a module should ne responsible to one, and only one, actor

Can a service be managed by a small, agile team? 

Avoid the entity trap: database entities mapped to services

- Example: Sandwich - recipe and ingredient as dedicated services. 

Experiment to find the right granularity for your context.

### Topology

Every service has all it needs to realize its business goal

- Shared database increase coupling

API Gateway acts as a service-access facade

- Clients don't need to know service endpoints.
- Can perform various functions:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - loading
  - balancing

### Front End Variety



### Cross-cutting concerns

A concern applicable throughout the application and it affect the entire application.

Operational concerns like monitoring and logging benefit from coupling.

#### Sidecar Pattern

A single-node pattern made up to containers

- application container core logic for the application
- sidecar container: augment the application container with cross-cutting concerns

#### Service Mesh

A dedicated infrastructure layer to control how services communicate with one another,

- Each service forms a node in the overall mesh
- The service mesh itself forms a console allowing holistic access to services.



### Scalability

Simple to scale horizontally by running multiple copies.

You can target scaling only microservices that need it

Load balancing mechanism is needed: 

- Distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources to make the overall processing more efficient.

### Elasticity

Microservices-based applications typically run in containerized environments.

- The number of instances of a service and its  locations changes dynamically

Service discovery keeps track of the addresses of all instances. 

- Based on demand new instances can be created
- Can be a dedicated service or part of a service mesh

Enabler of elasticity and on-demand provisioning of resources (cloud).

### Benefit

Small services foster testability and maintainability.

Services are independently deployable and scalable

- Positively impacts elasticity and resilience

Enables modern SE practices

- Automation (CI/CD, DevOps), 



### Disadvantages

Performance can be an issue as many network calls are needed to complete work.

Developers must implement the inter-service

- Use cases that span multiple services without using distribute
