### Waterfall Approach

The waterfall methodology is a project management approach that *emphasizes a linear progression from beginning to end of a project*.

#### Waterfall Lifecycle

#### Risk

Waterfall Method has most Risk profile on the late stage, between integrate and test stage. 

It delays critical risk resolution, delays discovery of defects, and precludes early development.


### Iterative & Incremental approach

Iterative: Project is divided into iterations.

Incremental: Functionality is added incrementally.

Key aspect: Work is prioritized based on **Risk**.

*Reduces project risks early*

#### Method Example

- Spiral
- Rational Unified Process (RUP)


### Agile approach

Agile is also Iterative & incremental, but:

Key aspect: Work is prioritized based on **Value**.

Which means that in the first iterate, the team will deliver the functionality that costumer wants the most but not the functionality that will gives highest project risk.

*Delivers value to customers early*

#### Method examples

- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Scrum 


### Lean approach

Lean: Lean is the western term for what the Japanese call Toyota Production System, which is the approach to manufacturing behind Toyota's success. It has been shown that this approach is largely applicable to software development.

Key aspect: Optimize end-to-end flow, from original idea to delivering to customer, by reducing **waste**. 

> A waste is anything that does not add custom value.  Most of the waste is generate between process.

*Lean focused more on entire workflow instead of individual processes.*

#### Method example

- Lean Software Development
- Kanban


### Hybrid Method

Hybrid: Mix of approaches.

Key goal: Leverage the best of different worlds

#### Example of hybrid frameworks

- Scaled Agile Framework
- Disciplined Agile Delivery
