## Security Analysis

The Security analysis is a process to answer - How do I know a system is secure?  

Things to consider:  

- What is the target system? 

  - Enumerate assets and their value
  - Operating value, replacement cost

- Who are the adversaries?

  - Identify attackers
  - Estimate attacker's resources
  - Probability of attack (risk assessment)

- What are the security requirement? 

  - Confidentiality
  - integrity
  - Authenticity

- What security approaches are effective?

  - Technological effectiveness vs cost effectiveness

>Security Properties and Objective
>- Confidentiality, privacy, secrecy
>- integrity
>- Availability
>- ...

## Security Approaches

- Social norm
- Legal enforcement
- Economics
   - Make the attack too costly to carry out.

### Technological Approaches

- Strong lines of defense: 
  - Cryptography
  - Firewall
- Redundancy
  - Approach taken by internet routing mechanisms
  - multiple paths to same destination - makes it much harder for an attacker to prevent communication
- Detection
  - Can be used as feed to legal system
- Preemptive strike
  - E.g., Peer-to-peer file sharing network poisoning
- Recovery
  - Back-ups, insurance

## Security Engineering

> Security is a process, not a product. --Schnier

Security is something you have to build into a system.

Security is perfectly to think at design stage.

Retrofitting security usually produce poor results.

To become a security engineering is by living, breathing and thinking about security all the time, instead of taking a class or getting a certification. 



## Threat Model

What is threat modeling? 

- It can mean many things: 
  - Finding out what may go wrong with your system
  - Build a set of attackers
  - Categorizing threats into classes
  -  ...

- Usually need two types of models
  - Model your systems
  - Model of the threats

### Benefit of Doing Threat Modeling

- Find security bugs early
- Understand security requirement (more later)
- Achieve better - more **robust**, **secure** - system design and architecture. 

### How to threat model? 

***There is no one-size fits all system.***

Threat modeling is and iterative process. We need to develop a repertoire and learn to think about new threat every time we make change to the system. 

Attacks, mitigations, requirement are intertwined. 

#### Key Question: 

1. What are you building?
2. What can we go wrong?
3. What should you do about things than can go wrong? 
4. Did you do a good job of analysis? 

### System Model

To do system modeling, consider following points : 

- Diagrams of the system
  - What are the components?
  - How data flow through the system?
- Trust boundaries
  - Who control/have access to each components? 
  - E.g., account/network interface/VMs, ...
- Attack surface
  - It's similar to trust boundary
  - Think about the set of APIs that the attackers can launch attacks

#### Things to consider: 

1. What attacker wants
   - User password, credentials
   - Social security number
   - Credit car number
   - Confidential business data
   - ...
2. Asset to protect
   - Customer data
   - Company reputation
   - Government information
   - ...
3. What are the stepping stones to get to either of the above
   - Computing resources
   - Software
   - ...

### Mind-Set on Threat Modeling

- Focusing on asset
  - How can attacker cooud threaten each asset? 
- Focusing on attackers
  - What attacker would do?
- Focusing on software and system
  - Build models that focus on software being built, or system being deployed
  - Detail assumption made

### Technique

There are multiple techniques to do Threat modeling.

#### Boolean Attack Tree

List all possible failure modes

Example : safe (*This example is still incomplete*)

<img src=''/>

#### Parameterized Attack Tree

It can be used to assess the cost of an attack and can use other quantities, such as, probabilities, instead.

Example: 

<img src=''/>

#### STRIDE

Stride is a threat model by Microsoft

It has 6 categories: 

1. Spoofing of user identity
2. Tampering
3. Repudiation
4. Information disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)
5. Denial of service (D.o.S)
6. Elevation of privilege

It Draw a picture of the system. 

Anywhere you see communication, this is a trust boundary where you should do analysis.
