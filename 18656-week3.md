## Recursion

Calling of a function within itself, usually with a different input.

A core technique used in functional programming instead of loops

- Problem broken into small part
- Easy to understand code repeat over and over
- 

### Syntax

`rec` keyword is used to define recursive expressions. 

```F#
let rec fib n =
	if n <= 2 then 1
	else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

`rec` allows to use a bound name within its definition.

**Practice:** Refactor is function to pattern-matching

```F#
let rec fib n =
	match n with
	| 1 | 2 -> 1
	| _ -> fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

### Anatomy of safe recursion

**Base case** allows the recursion to stop

- recursive call is absent from it
- require a clear stop condition (empty collection, countdown, etc.)

**Recursion cases** allows the recursion to continue

- describes ...

Generic structure of a recursive function in F#: 

```F#
let rec funcname input =
	match expr with
	| basscase_pattern ->
		basecase_expression
	| recursive_pattern ->
		recursive_expression
```

- One or more of each case type is necessary 

*what would happen if a recursive function does not have a base case, or never executes it?*

It would go into an infinite loop

*In an infinite loop, could a recursive function ever stop?*

- Whenever it turns out. ..
-  

Each recursive call should make progress toward the base case

- one of the arguments should get *smaller*
- never make a recursive call with the same parameters you were given

### Recursive with Lists

*Reminder: List is a combination of its head and tail*

- Recursive case: tail

- Progress toward the base case: head

- Base case: empty list

#### Exercise

Implement a function that sums a list of elements recursively: 

- Use match expression on the list argument
- Use head, tail and empty List

##### Solution

```F#
let rec sumOfList list = 
	match list with
	| head :: tail -> head + sum tail
	| [] -> 0
```
